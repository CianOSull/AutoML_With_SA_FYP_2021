# AutoML_With_SA_FYP_2021
Final Year Project for my Munster Technology University Software Development Honours Degree. The project is about researching the capabilities of AutoML libraries in running Sentiment Analysis.<br />
<br />
The Goal of this project was research the effectivness in using AutoML in Sentiment Analysis.<br />
<br />
How this project was done was that 6 libaries were used to create models for sentiment analysis using an IMDB Dataset of 50K Reviews labeled as positive or negative. These models were then tested and evaluated using  the metrics:<br />
1. Accuracy
2. Time
3. RAM
4. F1-Score
<br />
Each branch of this repository corresponds to a library used with the main branch being the generic IPython notebook layout used for each library. Each branch's notebook includes the results for the library inside the notebook.<br />
